## Design Principles (Reminder)

As we build new features, remember:

1. **Glanceable** - Info visible from across the room
2. **Collaborative** - Everyone feels ownership
3. **Motivating** - Completing tasks feels rewarding
4. **Fun** - This is a family app, not corporate software
5. **Simple** - Features should be intuitive, not overwhelming

---

## Notes

- This is a living document - priorities may shift based on family needs
- Each phase doesn't need to be complete before starting the next
- Some features may be combined or split during implementation
- The goal is joy, not feature completeness!
